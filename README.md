# Implementation-of-Quantum-Reservoir-Computing

Quantum machine learning, while it promises to speed up machine learning algorithms, fails to do so due to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. By implementing the imformation in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10956.pdf , we wish to use the Quera Aquila program in order to implement it on a quantum device
